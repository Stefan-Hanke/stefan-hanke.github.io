[Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) is *Infracstructure as Code* that actually *is* code. In this post I am describing my first steps using Pulumi and all dependency goodness that it brings.

# Installation

Since I did not do any development work personally for the last couple months (including a full reinstall), I had to install quite a bit of prerequisites for Pulumi to work. Since I have good experience using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), I've installed dependencies using it:

> choco install nodejs awssdk nodejs python

Pulumi itself is packaged as a choco package, so you can just run

> choco install pulumi

Pulumi needs access to your AWS account. There are two ways
 - provide credentials directly to pulumi
 - it can use credentials from AWS SDK.

 I've chosen the later path, installed the [AWS SDK CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/de/cli/) and ran `aws configure` once.

# On using Pulumi

Pulumi needs to store state, just like e.g. Terraform. Pulumi requires you to login to *some* account. By default, it directs you to creating an online account, however the [FAQ](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/troubleshooting/faq/) mentions that you can store the state locally.

> pulumi login --local

# Pulumi Terminology

## Project

A [Pulumi Project](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/project/) is a template of an actual infrastructure.

## Stack

A [Pulumi Stack](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/stack/) represents an actual infrastructure with its separate configuration. There could be more than one stack for a given project.

# First Steps

I've followed along the lines of the [AWS Getting Started](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/aws/install-pulumi/). It runs you through

 - creating an S3 Bucket,
 - modify that bucket to use server-side encryption, and
 - an finally destroy it.

The command `pulumi new aws-typescript` creates a new Pulumi project in the current folder. Notice the template name - this creates a project using the `AWS` cloud provider and the `typescript` language.

For more dependency fun, I had to install the `windows-build-tools` since of course some node dependencies needed node-gyp (see e.g. [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50561197/1262542)). After installing it, I noticed there are now `VS 2017 command prompts` available, though I did not install VS.

> npm install --global --production windows-build-tools

After that I pretty much just followed the tutorial. Some notable pulumi commands include:

- `pulumi up` creates the infrastructure
- `pulumi preview` shows what is to be changed
- `pulumi destory` destroys it again.

The stack itself is represented in its state file, located (in my example), at `file:///C:/Users/Stefan/.pulumi/stacks/dev.json`.

# Next Steps

The Pulumi homepage has some very nice [next step projects](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/aws/next-steps/), of which I'm certain I'll try a few ones.

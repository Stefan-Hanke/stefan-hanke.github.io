Hello, World!

This is the first post on my learning blog. I'm leveraging Jekyll and DevContainers to make it work.

* Jekyll is a static site generator and is used e.g. by GitHub to power their GitHub Pages (guess where GitLab Pages come from).
* [DevContainers][devcontainers-tut] utilize the VSCode Remote extension to allow to develop in whatever Language or environment you like, and don't leave your cozy Windows env.
    This is MIT licensed, checkout their [GitHub repo][devcontainers-gh]. There are a ton of other containers to try out.
